# Linux CL-Commands-search

With thousands of Comand-Line commands installed on a Linux system it can be a taunting task 
to find or memorize the commands that are relevent to a particular topic.

This script prompts the user to enter a search-word, finds the commands and their short description 
from the man-pages that contain the search-word and displays the matches. It also provides an option to 
read the manual pages of a particular command.

Please see the extended readme for examples.
